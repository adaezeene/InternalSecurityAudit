<h1>Internal Security Audit</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I completed an internal security audit for the fictional company Botium Toysâ€™ cybersecurity program. The audit needed to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit was meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that were classified as "high risk," and present an overall strategy for improving the organization's security posture. I needed to document my findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

<h2>Security Frameworks and Controls Used</h2>

- <b>Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad</b> 
- <b>NIST CSF</b>
- <b>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) security principles and security audits</b>
